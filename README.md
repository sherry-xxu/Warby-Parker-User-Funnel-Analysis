# Warby Parker User Funnel Analysis
Used SQL to analyze Warby Parker's marketing funnels and provide actionable insights.

### About
Warby Parker was founded in 2010 with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Its mission is to inspire and impact the world with vision, purpose, and style by providing higher-quality, better-looking prescription eyewear at a fraction of the going price.

### Scope
Two marketing funnels are included:
1. Quiz Funnel
- dataset: survey
2. Purchase Funnel
- datasets: quiz, home_try_on, purchase

By using a variation of functions in SQL, I will analyze the data collected along the company’s marketing funnels to calculate conversion rates and provide actionable insights.

### Conclusion
- Users tend to give up on survey when encountering questions no.3 and no.5.
- Users are more likely to purchase when they receive 5 pairs of home-try-on glasses.
- There is a business potential for men’s eyewear. On the “Purchase by Style” slide, men’s style glasses have a higher purchase rate. Among all the pricing for men’s style glasses, the higher-tier glasses ($150) are sold more than the cheaper options ($95 and $50) . Thus, Warby Parker can launch more campaigns that target towards male users.
